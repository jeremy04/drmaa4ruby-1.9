DRMAA 4 Ruby 1.9 Interface 

Originally written by Sun Microsystems

- DL library changed with Ruby 1.9
- FFI seemed appropriate to replace DL

Installation directions:

gem install echoe
gem install ffi


Creating the gem:

(If you want to become in charge of this (putting this on rubygems) please tell me!)

rake manifest
rake release
Press enter a couple of times
(Don't enter E-mail or password)
cd pkg/
gem install drmaa-0.0.1.gem


In fact maybe I should just include the pkg folder?
